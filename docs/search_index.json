There are a few goals of moving from “textbook + slides + exercises” to an ebook. To integrate course content (slides, readings, code, examples, and exercises) into one format, rather than having multiple files to sort through on Sakai. To address the perennial problem of choosing a textbook for this course – rather than having a required text, the goal is for this ebook to become the official course text. For supplementary texts, see the course syllabus. Most importantly, having a course text that is tightly aligned with the course content means that I can be more liberal in assigning readings as homework before class, so we can spend less time in lecture and more time discussing any questions you have about the readings, going through the examples in R together, and working on assignments. As a bonus, this book is another example of cool things you can do with R. It’s written in R (https://bookdown.org) – that is crazy, right?? "],["1.2-how-to-use-this-book.html", "1.2 How to use this book", " 1.2 How to use this book The book combines lesson slides (Powerpoint / PDF) and R coding exercises (Rmarkdown / HTML) familiar from EDUC 710. You have already seen that the chapter sections of this book are quite short, closer to “slide sized” than “book-section sized”. This is so that they can double as course slides. The main trick for incorporating R exercises is called “code folding”. An example of code folding is given on this page. Below, a histogram integrated into the text. By clicking on the button called “Show Code” on the top of the page, the R code that produced the histogram will also be visible. Notice that you may need to scroll horizontally to see all of the text in the code window. Also notice that when you hover your mouse over the code window, an icon appears in the top right corner – this lets you copy the block of code with one click. # Here is some R code. You don&#39;t have to look at it when reading the book, but it is here when you need it x &lt;- rnorm(200) hist(x, col = &quot;#4B9CD3&quot;) In summary, the basic workflow is as follows. Before class, go through the assigned readings for conceptual understanding. You can skip all the code during your first reading. We will go through the assigned readings again in class together, this time focusing on any questions you have and on doing R exercises. Alright, let’s get to it!

"],["2.3-ols.html", "2.3 OLS", " 2.3 OLS Intuitively, one approach to “fitting a line to the data” is to select the parameters of the line (its slope and intercept) to minimize the residuals. In ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, we minimize a related quantity, the sum of squared residuals: \\[ \\begin{align} SS_{\\text{res}} &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} e_i^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - a - b X_i)^2 \\end{align} \\] where \\(i = 1 \\dots N\\) indexes the respondents in the sample. OLS regression is very widely used and is the main focus of this course, although we will visit some other approaches (notably logistic regression) in the second half of the course. Solving the minimization problem (i.e., doing the calculus) gives the following equations for the regression parameters \\[ a = \\bar Y - b \\bar X \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad b = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{s^2_X} = r_{XY} \\frac{s_X}{s_Y} \\] (If you aren’t familiar with the symbols in these equations, check out the review materials in Section ?? for a refresher.)

This is why we didn’t make a big deal about simple regression in EDUC 710. But when we get to multiple regression (i.e., more than one \\(X\\) variable), we will see that relationship between regression and correlation (and covariance) gets more complicated. "],["2.4-r-squared.html", "2.4 R-squared", " 2.4 R-squared In the previous section we saw that the predicted value of Educational Achievement increased by .43 units (about half a percentage point) for each unit of increase in SES. Another way to interpret this relationship is in terms of the proportion of variance in Reading Achievement that is associated with SES – i.e., to what extent are individual differences in Reading Achievement associated with, or explained by, individual differences in SES? This question is represented graphically in Figure 2.3. The horizontal line denotes the mean of Reading Achievement. The difference between the indicated student’s Reading Achievement score and the mean can be divided into two parts. The black dashed line shows how much closer we get to the student’s score by considering \\(\\widehat Y\\) instead of \\(\\bar Y\\). This represents the extent to which this student’s Reading Achievement score is explained by the linear relationship with SES. The pink part is the regression residual, which was introduced in Section 2.2. This is the variation in Reading Achievement that is “left over” after considering the linear relationship with SES. Figure 2.3: The Idea Behind R-squared. The R-squared statistic summarizes the variation in Reading Achievement associated with SES (i.e., the black dashed line) relative to the total variation in Reading Achievement (i.e., black + pink) for all students in the sample. Aside from the regression parameters, R-squared is the most widely used statistic in regression analysis, so we will be seeing it a lot. Some authors call it the “coefficient of determination” instead of R-squared.

The second part is called the regression sum of squares and denoted \\(SS_\\text{reg}\\). Using this terminology we can re-write the above equation as \\[ SS_{\\text{total}} = SS_\\text{res} + SS_\\text{reg} \\] The R-squared statistic is \\[R^2 = SS_{\\text{reg}} / SS_{\\text{total}}. \\] As discussed above, this is interpreted as the proportion of variance in \\(Y\\) that is explained by its linear relationship with \\(X\\). "],["2.5-population-model.html", "2.5 The population model", " 2.5 The population model In the NELS example, the population of interest is U.S. eighth graders in 1988. We want to be able to draw conclusions about that population based on the sample of eighth graders that participated in NELS. In order to do that, we make some statistical assumptions about the population, which are collectively referred to as the population model. We talk about how to check the plausibility of these assumptions in Chapter ??. The regression population model has the following three assumptions, which are also depicted in the diagram below. Recall that the notation \\(Y \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\) means that a variable \\(Y\\) has a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). Normality: The distribution of \\(Y\\) conditional on \\(X\\) is normal for all values of \\(X\\). \\[Y | X \\sim N(\\mu_{Y | X} , \\sigma_{Y | X}) \\] Homoskedasticity: The conditional distributions have equal variances (also called homegeneity of variance). \\[ \\sigma_{Y| X} = \\sigma \\] Linearity: The means of the conditional distributions are a linear function of \\(X\\). \\[ \\mu_{Y| Χ} = a + bX \\] Figure 2.4: The Regression Population Model. These three assumptions are summarized by writing \\[ Y|X \\sim N(a + bX, \\sigma). \\] Sometimes it will be easier to state the assumptions in terms of the population residuals, \\(\\epsilon = Y - \\mu_{Y|X}\\), which subtract off the regression line: \\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma)\\). An additional assumption is usually made about the data in the sample – that they were obtained as a simple random sample from the population. We will see some ways of dealing with other types of samples later on the course (e.g., Chapter ??), but for now we can consider this a background assumption that applies to all of the procedures discussed in this course. "],["2.6-clarifying-notation.html", "2.6 Clarifying notation", " 2.6 Clarifying notation At this point we have used the mathematical symbols for regression (e.g., \\(a\\), \\(b\\)) in two different ways: In Section 2.2 they denoted sample statistics. In Section 2.5 they denoted population parameters. The population versus sample notation for regression is a bit of a hot mess, but the following conventions are widely used. Concept Sample statistic Population parameter regression line \\(\\widehat Y\\) \\(\\mu_{Y|X}\\) slope \\(\\widehat b\\) \\(b\\) intercept \\(\\widehat a\\) \\(a\\) residual \\(e\\) \\(\\epsilon\\) variance explained \\(\\widehat R^2\\) \\(R^2\\) The “hats” always denote sample quantities, and the Greek letters always denote population quantities, but there is some lack of consistency. For example, why not use \\(\\beta\\) instead of \\(b\\) for the population slope? Well, \\(\\beta\\) is conventionally used to denote standardized regression coefficients in the sample, so its already taken (more on this in the Chapter 4 ). One thing to note is that the hats are usually omitted from the statistics \\(\\widehat a\\), \\(\\widehat b\\), and \\(\\widehat R^2\\) if it is clear from context that we are talking about the sample rather than the population. This doesn’t apply to \\(\\widehat Y\\), because the hat is required to distinguish the predicted values from the data points. Another thing to note is that while \\(\\widehat Y\\) is often called the predicted value(s), \\(\\mu_{Y|X}\\) is not usually referred to this way. It is called the conditional mean function or the conditional expectation function. "],["2.7-inference-for-slope.html", "2.7 Inference for the slope", " 2.7 Inference for the slope When the population model is true, \\(\\widehat b\\) is an unbiased estimate of \\(b\\).

These are summarized below. See the review in Section ?? for background information on bias, precision, t-tests, and confidence intervals. 2.7.1 t-tests The null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\widehat b = b_0\\) can be tested against the alternative \\(H_A: \\widehat b \\neq b_0\\) using the test statistic: \\[ t = \\frac{\\widehat b - b_0}{s_{\\widehat b}} \\] which has a t-distribution on \\(N-2\\) degrees of freedom when the null hypothesis is true. The test assumes that the population model is correct. The null hypothesis value of the parameter is usually chosen to be \\(b_0 = 0\\), in which case the test is interpreted in terms of the “statistical significance” of the regression slope. 2.7.2 Confidence intervals For a given Type I Error rate, \\(\\alpha\\), the corresponding \\((1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%\\) confidence interval is \\[ b_0 = \\widehat b \\pm t_{(1-\\alpha/2)} \\times s_{\\widehat b} \\] where \\(t_{(1-\\alpha/2)}\\) denotes the \\(1 - \\alpha/2\\) quantile of the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(N-2\\) degrees of freedom.

This use of regression makes the most sense when we know the value of \\(X\\) before we know the value of \\(Y\\). When we are interested in using values of \\(X\\) to make predictions about (yet unobserved) values of \\(Y\\), we use \\(\\hat Y\\) as our guess. This is why \\(\\hat Y\\) is called the “predicted value” of \\(Y\\). When making predictions, we usually want some additional information about how good the predictions will be. In OLS regression, this information is provided by the prediction error variance (cite: Fox) \\[ s^2_{\\hat Y_i} = \\frac{SS_{\\text{res}}}{N - 2} \\left( \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{(X_i - \\bar X)^2}{(N-1) s^2_X} \\right). \\] The prediction errors for the data in Figure 2.2 are depicted in Figure 3.1 as a gray band around the regression line. # Using a different plotting library that adds prediction error bands (need to double check computation) library(ggplot2) ggplot(NELS[index, ], aes(x = ses, y = achmat08)) + geom_point(color=&#39;#3B9CD3&#39;, size = 2) + geom_smooth(method = lm, color = &quot;grey35&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Reading Achievement (Grade 8)&quot;) + xlab(&quot;SES&quot;) + theme_bw() Figure 3.1: Prediction Error for Example Data. Notice that the prediction error variance increases with \\(SS_{\\text{res}}\\) – in other words, the larger the residuals (Figure 2.2), the worse the prediction error. As we will see in this Section (??), one way to reduce \\(SS_{\\text{res}}\\) is to add more predictors into the model – i.e., multiple regression. 3.1.1 More about Prediction Prediction was the original use of regression (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean#History). More recent methods developed in machine learning also focus mainly on prediction – although the methods used in machine learning are often more complicated than OLS regression, and the research context is usually quite different, the basic problem is the same. Machine learning has led to the use of out of sample predictions, rather than prediction error, as the main criterion for judging the quality of predictions made from a model. Machine learning has also introduced some new techniques for choosing which potential predictors to include in a model (i.e., “variable selection”). We will touch on these topics later in the course, although our main focus is OLS regression. "],["3.2-regression-and-causation.html", "3.2 Regression and causation", " 3.2 Regression and causation A causal interpretation of regression means that that changing \\(X\\) by one unit will change \\(\\mu_{Y|X}\\) by \\(b\\) units. Note that this is an assumption about the population model, specifically the conditional expectation function. This is a much stronger interpretation than prediction because it requires stronger assumptions. In particular, regression parameters can only be interpreted causally when all variables that are correlated with \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) are included as predictors in the model. When a variable is left out, this is called omitted variable bias. This situation is nicely explained by Gelman and Hill (cite: Gelman), and a modified version of their discussion is provided below. This discussion is a bit technical, but the take-home message is summarized in the following points When a predictor variable that is correlated with \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) is left out of a regression model, this is called omitted variable bias. The overall idea is basically the same as saying “correlation does not imply causation” or the notion of spurious correlations. This is also an example of what is called “endogeneity” in regression (etymology: originating from within). In order to avoid omitted variable bias, we want to include more than one predictor in our regression models – i.e., multiple regression. 3.2.1 Omitted variable bias* We start by assuming a “true” regression model with two predictors. In the context of our example, this means that there is one other variable, in addition to SES, that is important for predicting Reading Achievement. Of course, there are many predictors of Reading Achievement (see Section ??), but we only need two to explain the problem of omitted variable bias. Let’s write the “true” model as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(X_1\\) is SES and \\(X_2\\) is any other variable that is correlated with both \\(Y\\) and \\(X_1\\) (e.g., number of books in the household). Next, imagine that instead of using the model in (3.1), we analyze the data using the model with just SES. In our example, this would reflect a situation in which we don’t have data on the number of books in the house, so we have to make due with just SES, leading to the usual regression line (Section 2.2): \\[ \\hat Y = a^* + b^*_1 X_1. \\tag{3.2} \\] The problem of omitted variable bias is that \\(b_1 \\neq b^*_1\\) – i.e., the regression parameter in the true model is not the same as the regression parameter in our data-analytic model with only one predictor. This is perhaps surprising – leaving out the number of books in the household gives us the wrong regression parameter for SES! To see why, start by writing \\(X_2\\) as a function of \\(X_1\\). \\[ X_2 = \\alpha + \\beta X_1 + \\epsilon. \\tag{3.3} \\] (Side note: by adding the residual into the model for \\(X_2\\), we ensure the equality holds for \\(X_2\\) not just \\(\\hat X_2\\) – more on this later.) Then we use Equation (3.3) to substitute for \\(X_2\\) in Equation (3.1), \\[\\begin{align} \\hat Y &amp; = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 \\\\ \\hat Y &amp; = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 (\\alpha + \\beta X_1 + \\epsilon) \\\\ \\hat Y &amp; = \\color{orange}{(a + \\alpha + \\epsilon)} + \\color{green}{(b_1 + b_2\\beta)} X_1. \\tag{3.4} \\end{align}\\] Notice that in the last line of Equation (3.4), \\(Y\\) is predicted using only \\(X_1\\), so it is equivalent to Equation (3.2). Based on this comparison, we can write \\(a^* = \\color{orange}{(a + \\alpha + \\epsilon)}\\) \\(b^*_1 = \\color{green}{(b_1 + b_2\\beta)}\\) This last equation for \\(b^*_1\\) is what we are interested in. It shows that the regression parameter in our data analytic model using just SES, \\(b^*_1\\), is not equal to the “true” regression parameter using both predictors, \\(b_1\\). This is what omitted variable means – leaving out \\(X_2\\) in Equation (3.2) gives us the wrong regression parameter for \\(X_1\\). This is one of the main motivations for including more than one predictor variable in a regression model – i.e., to avoid omitted variable bias. Notice that there two special situations in which omitted variable bias is not a problem: when the two predictors are not linearly related – i.e., \\(\\beta = 0\\), or when the second predictor is not linearly related to \\(Y\\) – i.e., \\(b_2 = 0\\). We will discuss the interpretation of these situations in class. "],["3.3-regression-and-explanation.html", "3.3 Regression and explanation", " 3.3 Regression and explanation In the social sciences, many uses of regression fall somewhere between prediction and causation. We want to do more than just predict outcomes of interest, but we often don’t have a basis for making strong assumptions required for causal interpretation of regression coefficients. This gray area between prediction and causation can be referred to as explanation. In terms of our example, we might want to explain why eighth graders differ in there Reading Achievement in terms of a large number of potential predictors, such as Student factors attendance past academic performance in Reading past academic performance in other subjects (Question: why include this? Hint: see previous section) School factors their ELA teacher the school they attend their peers (e.g., the school’s catchment area) Home factors SES Number of books in the household Maternal education Even this long list leaves out potential omitted variables. But, by including more than one predictor, we can get “closer” to a causal interpretation through “statistical controls” (See Chapter 3). When the goal of an analysis is explanation, it usual to focus on the proportion of variation in the outcome variable that is explained by the predictor(s), i.e., R-squared.
