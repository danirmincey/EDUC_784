It is currently under development, so any feedback is appreciated (e.g., during class, via email, or the edit link in the header). This first chapter is just about how to use the book – the course content starts in Chapter 2. summary { display: list-item; text-align: right; } summary::after { content: 'code' } details[open] > summary::after { content: 'hide' } 1.1 Why this book There are few goals of moving from “slides + exercises” to an ebook. To integrate course content (text, code, examples, and exercises) into one format, rather than having multiple files to sort through on Sakai. To address the perennial problem of choosing a textbook for this course – rather than having a supplementary text, the goal is for this ebook to be the official course text. Most importantly, having a course text that is “at the right level” means that I can be more liberal in assigning readings as homework before class, so we can spend less class time “lecturing” and more class time discussing any questions you have about the readings, going through the examples in R together, and working on assignments. As a bonus, this book is another example cool things you can do with R. It’s written entirely in R – that is crazy, right?? This book won’t replace Sakai (e.g., I still need to post assignments and grades somewhere). But, instead of the Sakai Lessons linking to a bunch of files on Sakai, they will link to this book. 1.2 How to use this book The book is going to replace the lesson slides (powerpoint) and R exercises (Rmarkdown / HTML) familiar from EDUC 710. The main trick for doing this is called “code folding.” An example of code folding is given below – you can see the histogram integrated into the text. Once you click on the button called “code” it will also show you the R code that produced the histogram. Note that you may need to scroll horizontally to see all of the text in the code window. Also note that when you hover your mouse over the code window, an icon appears in the top right corner – this lets you copy the full block of code with one click. # Here is some R code. You don&#39;t have to look at it when reading the book, but it is here when you need it x &lt;- rnorm(200) hist(x, col = &quot;#4B9CD3&quot;) So the basic workflow of how to use this book is as follows. Before class, go through the assigned readings for conceptual understanding. You can skip all the code during your first reading. We will go through the assigned readings again in class together, focusing this time on the code, as well as any questions you have. Alright, let’s get to it!

There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section. #code hide button??

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
