There are few goals of moving from “textbook + slides + exercises” to an ebook. To integrate course content (slides, readings, code, examples, and exercises) into one format, rather than having multiple files to sort through on Sakai. To address the perennial problem of choosing a textbook for this course – rather than having a required text, the goal is for this ebook to become the official course text. For supplementary texts, see the course syllabus. Most importantly, having a course text that is tightly aligned with the course content means that I can be more liberal in assigning readings as homework before class, so we can spend less time lecturing and more time discussing any questions you have about the readings, going through the examples in R together, and working on assignments. As a bonus, this book is another example cool things you can do with R. It’s written in R (https://bookdown.org) – that is crazy, right?? "],["1.2-how-to-use-this-book.html", "1.2 How to use this book", " 1.2 How to use this book The book combines lesson slides (Powerpoint / PDF) and R coding exercises (Rmarkdown / HTML) familiar from EDUC 710, and, to a lesser extent, the optional course textbooks (see syllabus). You have already seen that the chapter sections of this book are quite short, closer to “slide sized” than “book-section sized.” This is so that they can double as course slides. The main trick for incorporating R exercises is called “code folding.” (Note: I am still working out some bugs…) An example of code folding is given on this page. Below you can see a histogram integrated into the text. By clicking on the button called “Show Code” on the top of the page, the R code that produced the histogram will also be visible. Notice that you may need to scroll horizontally to see all of the text in the code window. Also notice that when you hover your mouse over the code window, an icon appears in the top right corner – this lets you copy the block of code with one click. # Here is some R code. You don&#39;t have to look at it when reading the book, but it is here when you need it x &lt;- rnorm(200) hist(x, col = &quot;#4B9CD3&quot;) So the basic workflow of how to use this book is as follows. Before class, go through the assigned readings for conceptual understanding. You can skip all the code during your first reading. We will go through the assigned readings again in class together (as slide show), this time focusing any questions you have and on doing R exercizes. Alright, let’s get to it!

"],["2.1-Example-2.html", "2.1 An example from NELS", " 2.1 An example from NELS Figure 2.1 shows the relationship between Grade 8 Reading Achievement and Socioeconomic Status (SES) using a subsample of the 1988 National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS; see https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88/). # Load and attach the NELS88 data load(&quot;NELS.RData&quot;) attach(NELS) # Scatter plot plot(x = ses, y = achmat08, col = &quot;#4B9CD3&quot;, ylab = &quot;Reading Achievement (Grade 8)&quot;, xlab = &quot;SES&quot;) # Run the regression model mod &lt;- lm(achmat08 ~ ses) # Add the regression line to the plot abline(mod) Figure 2.1: Reading Achievement and SES (NELS88). The strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables is summarized by their correlation (specifically, the Pearson product moment correlation). In this sample, the correlation is options(digits = 2) cor(achmat08, ses) ## [1] 0.32 This is a moderate, positive correlation between Reading Achievement and SES. The correlation means that eighth graders from more well-off families (higher SES) also tended to do better in reading (higher Reading Achievement). This relationship has been widely documented and discussed in education research (e.g., https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/education). What do you think about this relationship? In terms of Figure 2.1, the magnitude (strength) of the correlation can be interpreted in terms of how close the points are to the line. If the correlation was exactly one, all of the points would be on the line. If the correlation was zero, the points would be scattered without any (linear) trend at all. See the review materials in Section ?? for more info about correlation. "],["2.2-regression-line.html", "2.2 The regression line", " 2.2 The regression line The line in the Figure 2.1 can be represented mathematically as \\[ \\hat Y = a + b X\\] where \\(Y\\) denotes Reading Achievement (the Y-value of the blue dots) \\(X\\) denotes SES (the X-value of the blue dots) \\(\\hat Y\\) represented the values of \\(Y\\) on the line \\(a\\) represents the regression intercept (the value of \\(\\hat Y\\) when \\(X = 0\\)) \\(b\\) represents the regression slope (how much \\(\\hat Y\\) increases for each unit of increase in \\(X\\)) Note that \\(Y\\) is used to represent the actual data whereas \\(\\hat Y\\) represents the points on the line. The difference \\(e = Y - \\hat Y\\) is called a residual. The residuals for a subset of the data points in Figure 2.1 are shown in pink in Figure 2.2 # Get predicted values from regression model yhat &lt;- mod$fitted.values # select a subset of the data set.seed(10) index &lt;- sample.int(500, 30) # plot again plot(x = ses[index], y = achmat08[index], ylab = &quot;Reading Achievement (Grade 8)&quot;, xlab = &quot;SES&quot;) abline(mod) # Add pink lines segments(x0 = ses[index], y0 = yhat[index] , x1 = ses[index], y1 = achmat08[index], col = 6, lty = 2) # Overwrite dots to make it look at bit better points(x = ses[index], y = achmat08[index], col = &quot;#4B9CD3&quot;, pch = 16) Figure 2.2: Residuals for a Subsample of Figure 1. Intuitively, one approach to “fitting a line to the data” is to select the parameters of the line (its slope and intercept) to minimize the residuals. In ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, we minimize a related quantity, the sum of squared residuals: \\[ \\begin{align} SS_{\\text{res}} &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} e_i^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - \\hat Y_i)^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - a - b X_i)^2 \\end{align} \\] where \\(i = 1 \\dots N\\) indexes the respondents in the sample. OLS regression is very widely used and is the main focus of this course, although we will visit some other approaches (notably logistic regression) in the second half of the course. Solving the minimization problem (i.e., doing the calculus) gives the following equations for the regression parameters \\[ a = \\bar Y - b \\bar X \\quad \\quad b = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{s^2_X} = r_{XY} \\frac{s_X}{s_Y} \\] If you aren’t familiar with the symbols in these equations, check out the review materials in Section ?? for a refresher. Note that if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are transformed to z-scores (i.e., to have mean of zero and variance of one), then \\(a = 0\\) \\(b = \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = r_{XY}\\) So, regression, correlation, and covariance are all very closely related in when we only consider two variables at a time. This is why we didn’t make a big deal about simple regression in EDUC 710. But when we get to multiple regression (i.e., more than one \\(X\\) variable), we will see that relationship between regression and correlation (and covariance) gets more complicated. "],["2.3-three-uses-of-regression.html", "2.3 Three uses of regression", " 2.3 Three uses of regression Before moving onto more complicated regression models, let’s consider why we might be interested in them first place. As discussed in the following sections, regression has three main uses: Prediction (focus on \\(\\hat Y\\)) Causation (focus on \\(b\\)) Explanation (focus on \\(R^2\\), which is defined below) "],["2.4-regression-for-prediction.html", "2.4 Regression for prediction", " 2.4 Regression for prediction Prediction (etymology: “to make known beforehand”) means that we want to use \\(X\\) to make a guess about \\(Y\\). This use of regression makes the most sense when we know the value of \\(X\\) before we know the value of \\(Y\\). When we are interested in using values of \\(X\\) to make predictions about (yet unobserved) values of \\(Y\\), we use \\(\\hat Y\\) as our guess. This is why \\(\\hat Y\\) is called the “predicted value” of \\(Y\\). When making predictions, we usually want some additional information about how good the predictions will be. In OLS regression, this information is provided by the prediction error variance (cite: Fox) \\[ s^2_{\\hat Y_i} = \\frac{SS_{\\text{res}}}{N - 2} \\left( \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{(X_i - \\bar X)^2}{(N-1) s^2_X} \\right). \\] The prediction errors for the data in Figure 2.2 are depicted in Figure 2.3 as a grey band around the regression line. # Using a different plotting library that adds prediction error bands (need to double check computation) library(ggplot2) ggplot(NELS[index, ], aes(x = ses, y = achmat08)) + geom_point(color=&#39;#3B9CD3&#39;, size = 2) + geom_smooth(method = lm, color = &quot;grey35&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Reading Achievement (Grade 8)&quot;) + xlab(&quot;SES&quot;) + theme_bw() Figure 2.3: Prediction Error for Example Data. Notice that the prediction error variance increases with \\(SS_{\\text{res}}\\) – in other words, the larger the residuals (Figure 2.2), the worse the prediction error. As we will see in this Section (??), one way to reduce \\(SS_{\\text{res}}\\) is to add more predictors into the model – i.e., multiple regression. 2.4.1 More about Prediction Prediction was the original use of regression (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean#History). More recent methods developed in machine learning also focus mainly on prediction – although the methods used in machine learning are often more complicated than OLS regression, and the research context is usually quite different, the basic problem is the same. Machine learning has led to the use of out of sample predictions, rather than prediction error, as the main criterion for judging the quality of predictions made from a model. Machine learning has also introduced some new techniques for choosing which potential predictors to include in a model (i.e., “variable selection”). We will touch on these topics later in the course, although our main focus is OLS regression. "],["2.5-regression-and-causation.html", "2.5 Regression and causation", " 2.5 Regression and causation A causal interpretation of regression means that that changing \\(X\\) by one unit will change \\(Y\\) by \\(b\\) units. This is a much stronger interpretation than prediction because it requires stronger assumptions. In particular, regression parameters can only be interpreted causally when all variables that are correlated with \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) are included as predictors in the model. When a variable is left out, this is called omitted variable bias. This situation is nicely explained by Gelman and Hill (cite: Gelman), and a modified version of their discussion is provided below. This discussion is a bit technical, but the take-home message is summarized in the following points When a predictor variable that is correlated with \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) is left out of a regression model, this is called omitted variable bias. The overall idea is basically the same as saying “correlation does not imply causation” or the notion of spurious correlations. This is also an example of what is called “endogeneity” in regression (etymology: originating from within). In order to avoid omitted variable bias, we want to include more than one predictor in our regression models – i.e., multiple regression. 2.5.1 Omitted variable bias* We start by assuming a “true” regression model with two predictors. In the context of our example, this means that there is one other variable, in addition to SES, that is important for predicting Reading Achievement. Of course, there are many predictors of Reading Achievement (see Section 2.1), but we only need two to explain the problem of omitted variable bias. Let’s write the “true” model as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(X_1\\) is SES and \\(X_2\\) is any other variable that is correlated with both \\(Y\\) and \\(X_1\\) (e.g., number of books in the household). Next, imagine that instead of using the model in (2.1), we analyse the data using the model with just SES. In our example, this would reflect a situation in which we don’t have data on the number of books in the house, so we have to make due with just SES, leading to the usual regression line (Section 2.2): \\[ \\hat Y = a^* + b^*_1 X_1. \\tag{2.2} \\] The problem of omitted variable bias is that \\(b_1 \\neq b^*_1\\) – i.e., the regression parameter in the true model is not the same as the regression parameter in our data-analytic model with only one predictor. This is perhaps surprising – leaving out the number of books in the household gives us the wrong regression parameter for SES! To see why, start by writing \\(X_2\\) as a function of \\(X_1\\). \\[ X_2 = \\alpha + \\beta X_1 + \\epsilon. \\tag{2.3} \\] (Side note: by adding the residual into the model for \\(X_2\\), we ensure the equality holds for \\(X_2\\) not just \\(\\hat X_2\\) – more on this later.) Then we use Equation (2.3) to substitute for \\(X_2\\) in Equation (2.1), \\[\\begin{align} \\hat Y &amp; = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 \\\\ \\hat Y &amp; = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 (\\alpha + \\beta X_1 + \\epsilon) \\\\ \\hat Y &amp; = \\color{orange}{(a + \\alpha + \\epsilon)} + \\color{green}{(b_1 + b_2\\beta)} X_1. \\tag{2.4} \\end{align}\\] Notice that in the last line of Equation (2.4), \\(Y\\) is predicted using only \\(X_1\\), so it is equivalent to Equation (2.2). Based on this comparison, we can write \\(a^* = \\color{orange}{(a + \\alpha + \\epsilon)}\\) \\(b^*_1 = \\color{green}{(b_1 + b_2\\beta)}\\) This last equation for \\(b^*_1\\) is what we are interested in. It shows that the regression parameter in our data analytic model using just SES, \\(b^*_1\\), is not equal to the “true” regression parameter using both predictors, \\(b_1\\). This is what omitted variable means – leaving out \\(X_2\\) in Equation (2.2) gives us the wrong regression parameter for \\(X_1\\). This is one of the main motivations for including more than one predictor variable in a regression model – i.e., to avoid omitted variable bias. Notice that there two special situations in which omitted variable bias is not a problem: when the two predictors are not linearly related – i.e., \\(\\beta = 0\\), or when the second predictor is not linearly related to \\(Y\\) – i.e., \\(b_2 = 0\\). We will discuss the interpretation of these situations in class. "],["2.6-regression-for-explanation.html", "2.6 Regression for explanation", " 2.6 Regression for explanation In the social sciences, many uses of regression fall somewhere between prediction and causation. We want to do more than just predict outcomes of interest, but we often don’t have a basis for making strong assumptions required for causal interpretation of regression coefficients. This grey area between prediction and causation can be referred to as explanation. In terms of our example, we might want to explain why eighth graders differ in there Reading Achievement in terms of a large number of potential predictors, such as Student factors attendence past academic performance in Reading past academic performance in other subjects (Question: why include this? Hint: see previous section) School factors their ELA teacher the school they attend their peers (e.g., the school’s catchment area) Home factors SES Number of books in the household Maternal education Even this long list leaves out potential omitted variables. But, by including more than one predictor, we can get “closer” to a causal interpretation through “statistical controls” (See Chapter 3). When the goal of an analysis is explanation, it usual to focus on the proportion of variation in the outcome variable that is explained by the predictor(s) This proportion of variance is denoted \\(R^2\\) (“R-squared”) and is the first topic we address in our next lesson … "],["2.7-end-of-first-lesson.html", "2.7 End of first lesson", " 2.7 End of first lesson "],["2.8-the-lm-function.html", "2.8 The lm function", " 2.8 The lm function The functionlm, short for “linear model,” can estimate linear regressions using OLS and provide a lot of useful output.
