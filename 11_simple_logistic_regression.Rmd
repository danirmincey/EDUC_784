The last topic we address in this course logistic regression. Like the previous two chapters, logistic regression is an extension of multiple linear regression to situations in which the "standard" model does not directly apply. This time, the extension is to binary *outcome* variables. 

There are many situations in which the outcome of interest can be thought of as a binary or “yes / no” or “true / false” outcome:

* Death (the original logistic outcome; [Berkson, 1944](https://doi.org/10.2307%2F2280041))
* Onset of disease or condition
* Employment status
* College enrollment
* Passing a course or completing a credential
* Provide a correct response to a test question
* ... 

Just like with linear regression, we often we want to relate these types of binary variables to predictors, such as medical history, family background, personal characteristics, etc. That is what logistic regression does. 

The main theme of this chapter is also an extension of the previous two chapters. We have seen a general strategy for how to deal with data that do not "fit" the assumptions of linear regression: 

1. Transform one or more variable so that the data *do* fit the assumptions linear regression. 
2. Run the analysis as usual.
3. Then work out the interpretation of results in terms of the original variable(s). 

We will see this basic approach again in this chapter. In fact, its kind of a general-purpose hack for quantitative research -- when you are faced with a problem you don't know how to deal with, turn it into something you do know how to deal with. Certainly this is not the most creative approach, but it has the advantage of letting us "port over" many of the tools we have developed in one context (regression with a continuous outcome) into a new context (regression with a binary outcome). 

In terms of statistical modeling, the move to binary outcome variables is a pretty big deal. Everything we have done up until now has focused on OLS regression, using the same basic principles we discussed in Chapters \@ref(chapter-2) and \@ref(chapter-4). However, logistic regression takes us into the wider framework of *generalized linear models* (GLMs), which are estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) rather than OLS. Thus we will need to start at the "ground floor" to build up our knowledge of logistic regression, which then provides a stepping stone to GLMs, which can additionally handle other types of outcome variables (e.g., count data, ordered categorical data). 

Although we will focus on logistic regression, it should be noted that researchers who have a strong preference for OLS methods (AKA economists) often approach binary data using the "linear probability model," which is just OLS with the binary outcome. This approach violates all of the assumptions of linear regression, can lead to predicted probabilities outside of the range [0,1], produces incorrect standard errors for model parameters, and is, in a word, wrong. Yet, despite all this, it works pretty well in some situations and has the benefit of being much easier to interpret than logistic regression. We will point out the situations in which the linear probability model is "close enough" in Section \@ref(logit-11). 

Since we are starting with a new modeling approach, let's kick things of with a new example. 

## The CHD example {#chd-example-11}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

As a working example, we will use data contained in the file `CHD.RData` to explore the relationship between age in years ("age") and evidence (absence or presence) of coronary heart disease ("chd").  The dataset contain 100 cases. Respondents' ages range from 20 to 69, while evidence of CHD is coded 0 when it is absent and 1 when it is present. A sample of 20 cases is shown  below. (Source: Applied Logistic Regression by David W. Hosmer and Stanley Lemeshow, 1989, John Wiley and Sons.) 

```{r}
load("CHD.RData")
knitr::kable(list(chd.data[sample(1:100, 10),2:3], chd.data[sample(1:100, 10),2:3]), row.names = F, caption = "The CHD example")
```

If we regress chd on age using linear regression (i.e., the linear probabilty model), our diagnostic plots look like this: 

```{r, lpm, echo = F, fig.cap = "Linear probability model with CHD example", fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 12}
mod1 <- lm(chd ~ age, data = chd.data)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(mod1, 1)
plot(mod1, 2)
summary(mod1)
```

**Please take a moment to write down you conclusions about whether the assumptions of linear regression are met for these data, and any other details you may notice about the linear probability model.**

## Logit & logistic functions {#logit-11}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

The general game plan for dealing with a binary outcome is to transform it into a different variable that is easier to work with, run the analysis, and then "reverse-transform" the model coefficients so that they are intepretable in terms of the original binary variable. This strategy should sound familiar from Chapter \@ref(chapter-9) -- it's the same overall approach we used for log-linear regression. Also in common with Chapter \@ref(chapter-9), we are going to be use logs and exponents as the main workhorse for this approach (that is where the "log" in logistic comes from).

However, the overall strategy for transforming the $Y$ variable in logistic regression is a wee bit more complicated than the log-linear model. So, it is helpful to start wit an overall "roadmap".  

* Step 1 (from binary to probability). First, we are going to work with probabilities rather than original binary variable. In terms of our example, we are going to shift focus from whether or not a person has CHD to the *probability* of a person having CHD. 

* Step 2 (from probability to logistic). The logistic function is widely used model for probabilities. In terms of our example, we are going to use the logistic function to relate the probability of a person having CHD to their age. 

* Step 3 (from logistic to logit). The logistic function has a nice interpretation, but it is not a linear function of age. So, we are going to transform it into something that is linear in age, which will let us "port over" a lot of what we have learned so far about linear models. Actually, the reason we choose the logistic function as a model of probability is because this transform is relatively straightforward and can be "undone" afterwards when interpreting the model coefficients, just like with log-linear regression. The transformation two steps:

    * Step3A (probability to odds). First we transform the probability of having CHD into the *odds* of having CHD. If $p$ denotes probability then odds are just $p / (1-p)$. We will spend a while talking about how to interpret odds. 
    
    * Step 3B (odds to logit). Then we take the log of the odds, which is called the *logit*. The logit turns out to be a linear function of age, so we can model the relationship between age and the logit of CHD in a way that is very similar to regular linear regression. 
    
So that's the overall approach to dealing with a binary variable in logistic regression. Clear as mud, right? Don't worry, we will walk through each step in the following subsections. 

To be honest, this section is really a bit of a slog. But it will pay off! Once we get through this section, we are more or less back to linear regression.  If you find yourself getting lost in the details, it can be helpful to refer back to this overall strategy. In short, the overall game plan is: 

\[ \text{binary outcome} \rightarrow \text{probability} \rightarrow \text{logistic} \rightarrow \text{logit (log odds) }  \]
  
Then, once we are the logit, we can start doing linear regression again! 


### From binary to probability

The following table presents the example data in terms of the proportion of with CHD, broken down by age groups. The first column shows the age groups, the second shows the number of cases with CHD, the third shows the number of cases without CHD, and the last column shows the proportion of cases with CHD. 

```{r, props, echo = T, fig.cap = "From a binary variable to proportions", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/props.png")
```

Recall that the proportion of cases with a certain characteristic is computed as the number of cases with the characteristic over the total number of cases. In terms of the table above: 

\[ p(CHD = 1) = \frac{ N_1}{N_0 + N_1 } 
(#eq:prob)\]

were $N_1$ denotes the number of cases with CDH, and $N_0$ is the number of cases without. 

The number $p(CHD = 1)$ can be interpreted in many ways, which leads to a lot of terminology here. 

* The *proportion* of cases in our sample with CHD.
* If we multiply by 100, it is the *percentage* of cases with CHD (i.e., cases per 100) in our sample.
* If we multiply by a number other than 100 (say 1000), it is the *rate* of CHD (e.g., cases per 1000) in our sample.
* Since a proportion is just the mean of binary variable, it is the *mean* CHD in our sample.
* And finally, since proportions are one interpretation of probability, it is the *probability* of CHD in our sample. 

You might hear all of these terms (i.e., proportion, percentage, rate, mean, probability) used in connection with logistic regression. But, they are all basically all just different ways of referring the rightmost column of Figure \@ref(fig:props). I will try to make a point of using all of these terms so you get used to interpreting them in this context :)  

Another concept that will be useful for interpreting our data is *odds*. Odds are closely related to, but not the same as, probability. The figure below adds the odds of having CHD to Figure \@ref(fig:props). 

```{r, odds, echo = T, fig.cap = "Proportions and odds", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/odds.png")
```

As shown in the table, the odds are also a function of the two sample sizes, $N_1$ and $N_0$:

\[ \text{odds}(CHD = 1) = \frac{ N_1}{N_0}. 
(#eq:odds)
\]

Let's take a moment to compare the interpretation of probability versus odds. 

* The first row of the table tells us that the probability of having CHD in your 20's is "1 in 10". Loosley, this means that for every 10 people in their 20s, one of them will have CHD. 

* By contrast, the odds of having CHD in your twenties is "1 to 9". Roughly, this means that for every person in their twenties with CHD, there are nine without CHD. 

Clearly, probabilities and odds are just two different ways of packaging the same information. The following equations shows the relations between odds and probability (you can derive these from Equations \@ref(eq:prob) and \@ref(eq:odds))

\begin{align}
p(CHD = 1) & = \frac{\text{odds}(CHD = 1)}{1 + \text{odds}(CHD = 1)} \\ \\
\text{odds}(CHD = 1) & = \frac{p(CHD = 1)}{1 - p(CHD = 1)} 
(#eq:p2o)
\end{align}


We will see these relations again shortly. But, before moving, let's get some more practice interpreting odds and probabilities using the data in Figure \@ref(fig:odds). **Please write down your answers to the following questions and be prepared to share them in class. For each question provide both a verbal interpretation of the numerical answer (e.g, odds of 2 to 1 means that for every two people with a trait, there is one without.) **

* What is the probability of a person in their 40s having CHD? 
* What are the odds of a person in their 40s having CHD? 
* What is the probability of someone in their 50s **not** having CHD? 
* What are the odds of someone in their 50s **not** having CHD? 
* What is probability of having CHD in your 40s, compared to your 30s? (e.g., is 3 times higher? 4 times higher?)
* What are the odds of having CHD in your 40s, compared to your 30s? 


### From probability to logistic 

On thing you may have noted about our CHD data is that the proportion of cases with CHD increases with age. This relationship is shown visually in Figure \@ref(fig:chd2) below.

```{r, chd2, echo = T, fig.cap = "Proportion of cases with CHD as a function of age", fig.align = 'center'}
attach(chd.data)
prop <- tapply(chd, catage, mean)
years <- unique(catage)*10
plot(years, prop, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "#4B9CD3", ylab = "p(CHD =1)", xlab = "Age categories")
detach(chd.data)
```
Looking at the plot, we might suspect that the relationship between the probability of CHD and age is non-linear. In particular, we know that probabilities cannot take on values outside of the range (0, 1), so the relationship is going to have to "flatten out" in the tails. For example, even if you are a baby, your probability of having CHD cannot be less than 0. And, even if you are centenarian, the probability can't be great than 1. 

Based on this reasoning, we know that the relationship between age and the rate of CHD should take on a sort of  "S-shaped" curve or "sigmoid". This S-shape is hinted at in Figure \@ref(fig:chd2) but is not very clear. Some clearer examples are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:sigmoids). 

```{r, sigmoids, echo = T, fig.cap = "Examples of sigmoids", fig.align = 'center'}
logistic <- function(x, a, b){exp(a*x + b) / (1 + exp(a*x + b))}
x <- seq(-5, 5, by = .1)
plot(x, logistic(x, 1, 0), type = "l", lwd = 2, col = 2, ylab = "logistic")
points(x, logistic(x, .75, -1.5), type = "l", lwd = 2, col = 3, ylab = "logistic")
points(x, logistic(x, 1.5,- 1), type = "l", lwd = 2, col = 4, ylab = "logistic")
points(x, logistic(x, 3, 2), type = "l", lwd = 2, col = 5, ylab = "logistic")
```

The mathematical equation used to create these S-shaped curves is called the logistic function, the namesake of logistic regression. Returning to our example, we can see in Figure \@ref(fig:chd3) that the logistic function provides a reasonable approximation for the relationship between the probability of CHD and age. 

```{r, chd3, echo = T, fig.cap = "Proportion of cases with CHD, data versus logistic", fig.align = 'center'}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(years, prop, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "#4B9CD3", ylab = "p(CHD =1)", xlab = "Age categories")
plot(20:60, logistic(20:60, .12, -5.2), col = "#4B9CD3", ylab = "logistic", xlab = "Age in years")
```
One important thing to notice about Figure \@ref(fig:chd3) is that the plot on the left required re-coding age into a categorical variable and computing the proportion of cases with CHD in each age category (see Figure \@ref(fig:props)). However, the logistic plot on the right did not require categorizing age. So, one advantage of using the logistic function is that we can model the probability of CHD as a function of age "directly", without having to categorize our predictor variables. And, just like with linear regression, we can easily extend the logistic approach to account for multiple predictor variables, which becomes very unwieldy with the categorical re-coding approach. 

The take home message of this section is that the logistic function is a nice way to to model how a proportion depends on a continuous variable like age. Next, we'll talk about the math of the logistic function in a bit more detail. 

Before moving on, notice that the logistic function is roughly linear for probabilities in the range $[.2, .8]$ (see Figure \@ref(fig:sigmoids)). As mentioned in the introduction of this chapter, this is the situation in which using linear regression with a binary outcome works "well enough". So, if you run a linear regression on your binary outcome, and none of the fitted / predicted values are outside the range $[.2, .8]$, you are in a situation where you might prefer to just use linear regression (despite it being technically wrong). 


### Logistic to log odds (logit) 

The formula for the logistic function (i.e., the function that produced the curves in Figures \@ref(fig:sigmoids)) is

\[ p = \frac{\exp(x)}{1 + \exp(x)}. 
(#eq:logistic)
\] 


This function maps the variable $x$ onto the interval $(0, 1)$. In Figure \@ref(fig:chd3) we saw that the logistic function can provide a nice model for probabilities. And, because of this, the logistic function is also non-linear function of $x$ (i.e., it is sigmoidal or S-shaped). 

However, a nice thing about the logistic function is that we can easily transform it into a linear function of $x$. Since we already know how to deal with linear functions (that is what this whole course has been about!), transforming the logistic into a linear function of $x$ will let us port over a lot of what we know about linear regression to situations in which the outcome variable is binary. In fact, this was part of the motivation for choosing the logistic in the first place, rather than some other S-shaped curve.

So, let's see how to get from our S-shaped logistic function of $x$ to a linear function of $x$. A little algebra with \@ref(eq:logistic) shows we can re-express the logistic function in terms of the odds: 

\[ \frac{p}{1- p} = \exp(x).
(#eq:exp-odds)
\]

Note that Equations \@ref(eq:logistic) and \@ref(eq:exp-odds) directly parallel the two expressions in Equation \@ref(eq:p2o). The only difference is that, in the logistic model, the odds are represented as an exponential function of the variable $x$, which is what Equation \@ref(eq:exp-odds) is telling us. 

In order to turn Equation \@ref(eq:exp-odds) into a linear function of x, all we need to do is get rid of the exponent. Do you remember how?? That's right, just take the log (see Section \@ref(math-review-9)): 

\[  \log\left(\frac{p}{1- p}\right) = x
(#eq:logit)
\]

This equation is telling us that the log of the odds is linear in $x$. The log-odds is also called the *logit*. The next section discusses how to interpret the logit. 

### Interpretation 

The relationship between the logistic, odds, and logit is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:logit). 

```{r, logit, echo = T, fig.cap = "Logistic, odds, and logit", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/logit.png")
```

* The left-hand panel shows the logistic function, which is our "intuitive-but-nonlinear" model for probabilities. In terms of our example, this panel is saying that the probability of having CHD is a logistic or S-shaped function of age. 

* The middle panel shows that the odds are an exponential function of $x$. In terms of our example, this means that the odds of having CHD are an exponential function of age. This is the main assumption of the logistic model, and we will revisit this assumption again in section \@ref(assumption-checking-11). 

* Finally, the right-hand panel shows the "not-really-intuitive-but-definitely-linear" model for the logit. In terms of our example, the logit of having CHD is a linear function of age. 

The logit is going to be our workhorse for logistic regression. In Section \@ref(simple-11), we will replace the variable $x$ with a simple regression model $a + bX$ to get simple logistic regression. In Section \@ref(multiple-11) we will extend simple logistic regression to multiple logistic regression, just like how we did for multiple linear regression. 

Although the logit is the workhorse, we generally don't want to work with the logit when it comes time to interpret the results. The situation here is a lot like log-linear regression (see Chapter \@ref(chapter-9)). In log-linear regression, we treated $\log(Y)$ as a linear function of our predictor variable(s). However, we didn't want to interpret the model in terms of $\log(Y)$, because, well, who thinks in log units? Instead we wanted an interpretation in terms of the original outcome, $Y$. One of the reasons the log-linear model is widely used is because it provides a nice interpretation in terms of proportional change in $Y$. 

Now, you might have already noted that the relationship between the logit (i.e., $\log(\text{odds})$) and $\text{odds}$ in logistic regression is the same as the relationship between $\log(Y)$ and $Y$ in log-linear regression. The parellel between the two model is as follows: 

* In the log-linear model we interpreted a $b$ unit increase in $\log(Y)$ in terms of an $\exp(b) - 1$ times increase in $Y$ (see Section \@ref(interpretation-9)). 

* In logistic regression we will interpret a $b$ unit increase in $\text{logit}(Y)$ in terms of an $\exp(b) - 1$ times increase in $\text{odds}(Y)$. 

So, while we use the logit function for modeling, we typically use the odds for interpretation, with the overall situation being directly parallel to log-linear modeling.

Recently, some authors have argued that people don't really know how to interpret odds properly. These authors suggest that we interpret the logistic model in terms of probabilities, rather than odds. We will discuss how to do this as well.  

### Pop quiz 

Before moving, lets nail down the relation between probability, odds, and logits. Figure \@ref(fig:logit-table) presents the relationship in tabular form. 

```{r, logit-table, echo = F, fig.cap = "Logistic, odds, and logit", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/logit-table.png")
```

**I will asks some questions along the following lines in class.**

* If logit < 0 then probability <  ? and odds < ? 
* What is larger: probability of .9 or odds of 9 to 1?  
* If the logit = 1.098 corresponds to probability = .75, what probability does logit = -1.098 correspond to? 


### Summary

At this point we have covered the overall logic of how we can model a binary outcome variable like CHD in terms of the logistic function. The overall situation is very similar to, but a bit more complicated than, log-linear regression. The main take aways are

* We use the logit (log-odds) for statistical analysis, because it results in a linear function, and we already know how to deal with linear functions -- that is what everything we have done up until now has been about. 

* We use the odds for interpretation, because the logistic model leads to proportional change in the odds, in the same way that the log-linear model leads to proportional change in $Y$. 

* We can also use probabilities for interpretation, but, since the logistic model implies that probabilities are non-linear (sigmoidal), things can get a bit complicated with this approach. 


## Simple logistic regression {#simple-11}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

In this section we move onto logistic regression proper. For the CHD example, the model we are interested in is 

\[ \text{logit}(CHD) = a + b (\text{age}). \]

We are going to skip a few steps and go right into the interpretation of the R output. Once we know how to interpret the output, we will loop back to discuss technical details in the following sections. 

The summary R output for the example is below. The focus for now is just the interpretation of the values under the "Estimate" heading. 

```{r}
mod2 <- glm(chd ~ age, family = binomial, data = chd.data)
summary(mod2)
```

Plugging the estimates into our logit model, we have the resulting equation

\[ \text{logit}(CHD) = -5.03  + .11 (\text{age}). \]

The "literal" interpretation of this equation is: 

* When $\text{age} = 0$, $\text{logit}(CHD) = -5.03$.
* For each unit of increase in age (i.e., each additional year), there is a .11 unit increase in $\text{logit}(CHD)$. 

While this interpretation is perfectly correct, most applied audiences are not going to know how to interpret   $\text{logit}(CHD)$. So, instead, we often work with the odds. In particular, the logistic regression model implies

\[ \frac{\text{odds} (X+1)}{\text{odds}(X)} = \exp(b)
(#eq:OR)
\]

where $\text{odds}(X)$ are odds of the binary outcome associated with a given value of the predictor $X$. Equation \@ref(eq:OR) is called the *odds ratio* (abbreviated OR) associated with a one-unit increase in $X$. If you compare Equation \@ref(eq:OR) to Equation \@ref(eq:expb), you can see we are using the same trick we used for the (exact) interpretation of log-linear regression. The derivation is also essentially the same (see Section \@ref(OR-derivation-11)). 

For the CHD example, the OR is

\[ \exp(b) = \exp(.11) = 1.116278 \] 

Just like the log-linear model, we report the results of our analysis in terms of proportion (or percent) change in the odds of CHD associated with each additional year of age: 

* $(\exp(.11) - 1) \times 100 = 11.67$, so a persons' odds of CHD increase 11.67% for each additional year of age. 

In many logistic regression application, the OR is reported instead of (or as well as) the regression coefficients from the logit model. We will discuss how to compute confidence intervals for the OR in Section \@ref(estimation-11). 

Before moving, **please practice your interpretation of the OR in simple logistic regression using the following examples**

* If $b=0$ what is the OR equal to? What is the percent change in the OR for a one unit increase in $X$? 
* If $b=.25$ what is the OR equal to? What is the percent change in the OR for a one unit increase in $X$? 
* If $b=-.025$ what is the OR equal to? What is the percent change in the OR for a 10 unit increase in $X$? 
* If the odds increase 100% for a one unit increase in $X$, what $b$ equal to? 

### Other interpretations: Predicted probabilities
Another way to interpret the logistic model is in terms of the predicted probabilities. An easy way to obtain a plot of the probabilities in R is to use the `visreg` function

```{r, pred-prob, echo = T, fig.cap = "Predicted probabilities", fig.align = 'center'}
visreg::visreg(mod2, xvar = "age", scale = "response")
```

We can read off the probability of CHD for any given age. We might also want to report the probability of CHD for two or more chosen ages, which is an example of the MERV approach to marginal effects:  

```{r}
library(emmeans)
emmeans(mod2, specs = "age", at = list(age = c(20, 40)), type = "response")
```

The ratio of two probabilities is often called the *risk ratio*. So, we could also that the risk ratio of CHD for someone who is 40 as compared to someone who is 20 is .2947 / .0435 = 6.77. Otherwise stated, the risk of having CHD when you are 40 years old is almost 7 times higher than it is for someone who is 20. 

### Other interpretations: Equal odds

Another interpretation of the logistic regression is to report the value of $X$ at which the $\text{odds}$ of the outcome are equal to 1 (equivalently, the probability of the outcome is equal to .5). This idea is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:equal-odds). 

```{r, equal-odds, echo = T, fig.cap = "The Equal Odds Interpretation", fig.align = 'center'}
x <- data.frame(age = 20:70)
prob <- predict(mod2, newdata = x, type = "response")
plot(x$age, prob, xlab = "age", ylab = "p(CHD)", type = "l", col = "#4B9CD3")
segments(x0 = 15, y0 = .5, x1 = 48, y1 = .5, lty = 2, lwd = 2)
segments(x0 = 48, y0 = 0, x1 = 48, y1 = .5, lty = 3, lwd = 2)
```

First we find the probability of .5 on the $Y$ axis and then follow the horizontal dashed line to the logistic curve. Then we follow the vertical dashed line down to the value of $age$. This gives use the age at which the probability of CHD is "50-50", or the odds of having CHD versus not having CHD are equal. Based on the plot we can say that, after your 48th birthday, your chances of having CHD are above 50%. 

The math behind this interpretation is below. Since

\[ \log(.5/.5) = \log(1) = 0 \]

We know can solve 

\[ a + b(\text{age}) = 0 \]

to find that age at which someone has equal odds of CHD. Doing the algebra shows that

\[ \text{age} = - a/b \]

For the example data

\[ \text{age} = - (-5.30) / .11 = 48.18 \]

which confirms the conclusion we made looking at the plot. In general, another way of interpreting regression coefficients in simple logistic regression is to compute $-a / b$, which gives the value of $X$ at which $p(Y = 1) = .5$. 

### Other interpretations: Rate of change

Another interpretation is in terms of the slope of the straight line (tangent) through the point $p(CHD) = .5$. This slope of this line describes the approximate rate of change in the probability of CHD for people who are "close to" equal odds.  

It turns out that the slope of the tangent line is equal to $b/4$. The derivation requires calculus and is omitted, but the line is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tangent) for our example. 

```{r, tangent, echo = T, fig.cap = "The Rate of Change Interpretation", fig.align = 'center'}
x <- data.frame(age = 20:70)
prob <- predict(mod2, newdata = x, type = "response")
plot(x$age, prob, xlab = "age", ylab = "p(CHD)", type = "l", col = "#4B9CD3")
abline(a = -.815, b = .11/4, lty = 2, lwd = 2)
```

For the example data $b / 4 = .11 / 4 = .0275$. So, for every additional year, the predicted probability of CHD increases by .0275 or 2.75%. However, this interpretation only applies to people who "around" the age of equal odds  (48 years old in this example). Looking at the plot, we can see that the approximation is pretty good for people between the ages of 40 and 60. (Note: This is also the age range over which the linear probability model would provide a reasonable approximation). 

### Summary 

The simple logistic regression model 

\[ \text{logit}(CHD) = a + b (\text{age}) \]

has the following interpretations. 

* In terms of the logit: 
    * The intercept ($a$) is the predicted value of the log-odds of CHD when age = 0. 
    * The slope ($b$) is how much the predicted log-odds of CHD changes for one unit (year) of increase in age.

* In terms of the odds: 
    * The exponent of the regression parameter, $\exp(b)$, is odds ratio for one unit of increase in age.
    * $(\exp(b) - 1) \times 100$ is the percentage change in the odds of CHD for a one unit increase in age. 

* In terms of predicted probabilities
    * The logistic plot provides a visual summary of how the probability of CHD changes as a function of age. 
    * Predicted probabilities can be reported for specific values of age (MERVs). 
    * Risk ratios can be computed comparing the predicted probabilities at different ages. 
    * $–a / b$ corresponds the age at which the probability of having CHD is "50-50"
    * $b / 4$ is the approximate rate of increase (slope) of the probability of having CHD for people close to the "50-50" point.  

**Please write down the numerical values all of the above summaries for the CHD example, except the predicted probability plot. You can select any values of age to reported the predicted probabilities and risk ratios, and you can "eye ball" the probabilities using Figure \@ref(fig:pred-prob).**  

## Estimation {#estimation-11} 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

The previous section discussed the interpretation of the simple logistic regression model. In this section we discuss how to get the numbers in the “Estimate” column of the summary table. 

In logistic regression, we use maximum likelihood (ML) rather than OLS to estimate the model parameters. The resulting estimates are called the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs). By understanding ML estimation, we will also be able to address 

* Testing model parameters for significance, confidence intervals, etc (Section \@ref(inference-11)) 
* The assumptions of logistic regression, and how to check them (Section \@ref(assumption-checking-11)) 

Let's first contrast ML with OLS. In linear regression, OLS regression leads to "closed form" expressions for the regression coefficients (e.g., Section \@ref(ols). This means we can write down an explicit algebraic equation for the regression coefficients, e.g., 

\[ b = \text{cov}(Y, X) / s^2_X \] 

As we discussed in the introduction, these estimates aren't usually very good when the outcome is binary. So, instead we use ML. 

The first thing to know about ML with logistic regression is that it does not lead to closed form expression for the regression coefficients. In other words, using algebra we can never write down the other side of the equation $b = ?$. Instead, we define the regression parameters *algorithmically* -- whatever values results from maximizing the likelihood is the value we choose for $b$. We discussed the difference between algebraic and algorithmic definitions when we compared the mean and median last semester. For now, the take home message is

* In OLS, we didn’t really have to know much about least squares per se, because we could just work with the formulas for the regression coefficients.  
* In ML, we really do need to know about likelihood, because we don’t get any other formulas for the coefficients.

### The likelihood 

The likelihood is a function that tells us the probability of sample being drawn from a population. For our example data, we have a sample $N = 100$ in which there are 43 people with CHD and 57 people without CHD. The likelihood tell us the probability of this sample being drawn from the population. In particular, when the variable of interest is binary, it is called the *binomial* likelihood. 

The building block of the binomial likelihood is the probability of a person having CHD. For person $i$, we use the shorthand notation

\[ p_i = p(CHD_i = 1) \] 

to denote the probability of having CHD. You might be thinking -- don’t we already know if person $i$ has CHD or not? Isn't that is what our data tell us!

That is true, but recall that we are imaging that person $i$ is sampled from a population, and in that population there are people who are exactly like person $i$ with respect to the predictors we have collected (e.g., of exactly the same age). Some proportion of those people will have CHD, and that is the probability we are interested in -- e.g., the probability of a person of age 48 having CHD in the population.

The likelihood of CHD for person $i$ is 

\[ L_i = p_i \times CHD_i + (1 - p_i) \times (1 - CHD_i) 
(#eq:Li)
\] 

This might look complicated but its just a way of writing the population probability of having CHD, or not having CHD, in one formula. All it says is: 

* The probability of sampling someone with CHD is $p_i$.
    * i.e., plug in $CHD_i = 1$ into Equation \@ref(eq:Li) and the answer is $p_i$.

* The probability of sampling someone without CHD is $1 - p_i$.
    * i.e., plug in $CHD_i = 0$ into Equation \@ref(eq:Li) and the answer is $1 - p_i$.
    
For a sample of $N$ **independent** persons (i.e., a simple random sample), the binomial likelihood is

\[ L = \Pi_{i = 1}^N L_i = L_1 \times  L_2 \times \cdots \times L_N
(#eq:L)
\] 

The symbol $\Pi$ is shorthand for multiplication, just like $\Sigma$ is used for addition. If we plug into Equation \@ref(eq:L) using CHD = 1 for 43 people and CHD = 0 for 57 people, this will give us the likelihood for example data set. 

Of course, the trick is that we need to know $p_i$. This is where the logistic regression model comes it -- it provides a probability of CHD for each person in our sample. In maximum likelihood estimation, we select the coefficients of the logistic regression model so that the likelihood in Equation \@ref(eq:L) is maximized. This is called the principal of maximimum likelihood. It says "chose the model parameters that make the observed data most likely". 

Maximizing the likelihood is complicated stuff, but that is what `R` is for. One complication that we should be aware of is that the likelihood can cause "underflow" issues in computing, because we are multiplying together lots of numbers less than 1, which can lead to very, very small values -- too small for a computer represent. To address this issue, we usually work with the log-likelihood, rather than the likelihood: 

\[ \ell = \log(L) = \log \prod_{i = 1}^N L_i = \sum_{i = 1}^N \log(L_i) 
(#eq:ell)
\] 

The last equality uses the "addition with logs" rule from Section \@ref(math-review-9). For our purposes here, we just need to know that taking the log of the likelihood changes a very small number (the likelihood) into a large negative number (the log-likelihood), which prevents your computer from breaking when doing computations. 

The log-likelihood $ell$ shows up a lot in what follows. In particular, when the log-likelihood is evaluated at the MLEs, $-2 \times \ell$ is called the *deviance.* 

### Summary 

Lets take a look at our summary output for the example data again: 

```{r}
summary(mod2)
```

This question has addressed the question: how do we get the numbers under the "Estimate" column. The answer is maximum likelihood (ML)! In short: 

* The likelihood function tells us the probability of sampling a given set of cases from a population – sometimes it is referred to as "the probability of the data". 
   * When the variable of interest is binary, it is called the binomial likelihood. 

* Intuitively, ML is based on the idea that the values of the model parameters that make the data most likely are the “best”
    * This is sometimes called the principal of maximum likelihood. 
    * The resulting values are called the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs). 

* Practically, ML is accomplished using a computer algorithm -- we can't write down algebraic expressions for the MLEs, we only have the algorithmic definition (FYI: the algorithm R uses is a version of Newton-Raephson called Fisher Scoring). 

The next section address where the rest of the numbers in the R output come from. Before moving on, please write down an answer to the following question: **In a few sentences, describe how the model parameters in logistic regression are estimated and how this compares to OLS regression**.
